  <h1>Chithi</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    Chithi is a monthly letter — written slowly — about language,
    politics, memory, culture, and responsibility.
    Each issue is accompanied by art, questions, and unfinished thoughts.

    <h2>Why Chithi</h2>
    <p>
      In a world that scrolls endlessly, Chithi pauses.
      It exists to make people question, care, and sit with discomfort
      rather than consume answers.
