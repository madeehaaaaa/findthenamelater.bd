      Everything About Bangla is not a project.  
      It is an archive of breath, memory, sound, and soil.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bangla was never born in classrooms.  
      It grew in the mouths of farmers, boatmen, mothers, poets, rebels,
      and children who did not know grammar but knew feeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      We exist to collect what textbooks forget
      the unfinished sentences, the folk rhythms, the mistakes that
      accidentally became beauty.
    </p>

    <p>
      This space holds language, art, music, radio, and letters  
      not as categories, but as living forms.
