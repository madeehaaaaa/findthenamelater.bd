# AOBD — Everything About Bangla

AOBD is a living archive of Bangla — its language, history, lost heritage, and regional accents.  
Here, we explore Shadhi Bhasha, Ancholikota, and the philosophies hidden inside words.  

This is not a blog. This is an exploration.  
A digital space for research, reflection, and preservation of our cultural identity.
