    <p>
      This is not a website.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an archive of breath —
      of how Bangla was spoken, written,
      sung, forgotten, and remembered again.

      A language does not survive in books.
      <br>
      It survives in mouths.

  <!-- EXPLANATION PANEL -->
  <section class="panel text-left">
    <p>
      AOBD exists to document Bangla beyond timelines and exams —
      beyond “pure” and “impure,”
      beyond approval.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here live dialects that never reached print,
      words spoken by rivers,
      grammar broken by love,
      and art painted on moving rickshaws.
